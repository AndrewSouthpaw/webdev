# CSS Page Layout

## Introduction to Page Layout

### What is CSS Page Layout?

  * HTML files specify a bunch of boxes with content

  * The browser needs to arrange those boxes on the screen

  * Arrangement is performed based on a set of layout rules

  * The layout can be changed in CSS, per box

### Layout Engines

We'll be looking at the following layout engines:

  * Block (`display: block|inline`)

  * Positioned (`position: absolute|relative|fixed`)

  * Floating (`float: left|right`)

  * Flexible Box (`display: flex`)
