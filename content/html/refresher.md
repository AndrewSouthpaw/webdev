## HTML Refresher

### What is HTML?

  - Hyper Text Markup Language

  - HTML is very error tolerant (browsers are very forgiving)

  - That said, you should strive to write good HTML

  - Structure of the UI and the content of the **view data**

  - Parsed as a tree of nodes (elements)

  - HTML5
    - Rich feature set
    - Semantic (focus on content and not style)
    - Cross-device compatibility
    - Easier!

### Anatomy of an HTML Element

  - Also known as: nodes, elements, and tags:

    ~~~ {.html}
    <element key="value" key2="value2">
      Text content of element
    </element>
    ~~~

### HTML Represented as Plain Text

~~~ {.html insert="../../src/examples/html/simple.html"}
