Parasitic Inheritance
---------------------

### Constructors that Aren't ###

Parasitic inheritance is created by:

  * Constructor or factory functions

  * They don't create their own objects

  * After having another function create an object they augment it in
    some way.

### An Example Using the `new` Operator ###
