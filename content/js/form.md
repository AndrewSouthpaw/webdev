## Form Validation with JavaScript

### JavaScript Form Validation Workflow

When validating a form with JavaScript:

  #. Listen for `input` events on the form inputs and validate the
     specific input that changed

  #. Listen for `submit` events on the form itself and validate the
     entire form, halting the submission if there are errors

### Exercise: JavaScript Form Validation

  #. Open (and edit) the following files in your text editor:

       - `src/www/css/form/form.js`
       - `src/www/css/form/index.html`

  #. Follow the directions in the JavaScript file

  #. Open the HTML file in your browser and confirm your changes
