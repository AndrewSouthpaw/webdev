### The Different Types of Methods

When you want to look up the documentation of a method it's useful to
know what type of method you are working with.

  * Generic Methods

    Similar to static class methods in other languages.  Examples:

      - `Array.isArray`
      - `Math.abs`
      - `Number.parseInt`

  * Prototype Methods

    Similar to instance methods in other languages.  Examples:

      - `Array.prototype.push`
      - `String.prototype.toLowerCase`
      - `Date.prototype.getFullYear`
