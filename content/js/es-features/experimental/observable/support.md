There is no native browser support for observable (it's still a [stage
1 proposal][proposal]).  However, there are several implementations:

  * [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)

  * [zen-observable](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable)

  * [fate-observable](https://github.com/shanewholloway/node-fate-observable)


[proposal]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable
