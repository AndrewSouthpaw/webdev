/**
 * Exercise 3
 * ============================================
 *
 * Display the current time in HH:MM:SS 24 hr format (e.g. 4:15:50 PM -> 16:15:50).
 * The clock should update every second.
 * Hint: you'll be working with the JS Date object:

 *
 * Extra hint: look under the "Methods" section on the left sidebar of the docs to figure
 * out what methods you might want to use.
 *
 * BONUS CHALLENGE: Now display it in hh:MM AM/PM format, e.g. 4:15 PM. Toggle the
 * time separator (the colon :) on or off each second to mark the passage of seconds.
